The English comprehension of the call centre staff I have dealt with is appalling. In 2021 it was announced the One (then Vodafone) call centre would be 'largely based in New Zealand by the end of the year'. I haven't once spoken to a call centre staff member in New Zealand, and, when requested, they have not been able to transfer me to a NZ based staff member.
