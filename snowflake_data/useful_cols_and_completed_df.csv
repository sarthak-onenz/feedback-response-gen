51,,,,,,,,Move your call centre back to NZ and train the staff better,"Pricing is reasonable, especially HFC, however the customer service is below what I expect. In the past 6 months I've had incorrect advice from an instore team member and spent hours on the phone with the call centre trying to get someone to understand my request (which admittedly was probably not a request they come across often). 

The English comprehension of the call centre staff I have dealt with is appalling. In 2021 it was announced the One (then Vodafone) call centre would be 'largely based in New Zealand by the end of the year'. I haven't once spoken to a call centre staff member in New Zealand, and, when requested, they have not been able to transfer me to a NZ based staff member. I would rather pay slightly more and have a NZ based call centre with One staff rather than generic call centre staff overseas who may not be employed under conditions that meet NZ minimum standards.",,

More clear information or follow up email with the ins and outs and what to expect when porting a number. I also feel this is not just a One NZ thing to improve. I had similar issues when changing to 2 Degrees. so industry information that should be clearer for all.,"Really great experience in the Riccarton store completing the sign up/switch to One NZ, I did have a few issues with my number porting from 2 degrees to One, none of the request 2FA codes I would request for signing into my accounts on my new device would come through for the first 48 hours",,
